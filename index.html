							<h2>Save The Date(s)!</h2>
							<p>Hello dearest family and friends! We are extremely excited to announce our marriage after a whirlwind romance of a mere 8 years, and we would like to invite all of you to celebrate our nuptials this year.</p>
							<p>As we are something of an international clan we will be holding two events: one in Devon, England, where Layla is from, and one in New York City where Shane currently lives. Your invite email will have told you which guest list you are on based on geographical convenience. But of course, if you feel like a bit of globe trotting let us know and we will be delighted to welcome you to both events!</p>

							<p>Check out the links below for more detailed information on each event.</p>
