							<p>Along with lots of delicious food we will be providing wine, fizz wine, and beer for you to enjoy with your meal. After that the party is BYOB, we will not have a cash bar so please do bring a bottle to share.</p>

							<h3>Transport</h3>
							
							<p>BY CAR:</p> 
							
							<p>The venue is 5 minutes drive from the Buckfastleigh exit on the A38.</p>

							<p>Using Google maps and/or satnav the TQ11 0HN postcode will take you to the neighbours at Bramlebye Farm - about 500 metres South South west of the house. We will of course signpost the directions clearly once you get to Buckfast </p> 

							<p>BY TRAIN:</p> 
							
							<p>Buckfast is also super easy to get to by train, with hourly trains running from London Paddington, via Exeter, to nearby Totnes. Once you get to Totnes, Buckfast is a short drive or cab journey away. </p>
							
							<p>OR (and here's where it gets exciting) there is a real life actual steam train from Totnes to Buckfastleigh! We will be organising a group rate ticket on the steam train and a shuttle from the steam train station to the venue so please let us know if you would like to take this option. you can let us know on the Facebok page or by emailing us at Shane.and.Layla.2014@gmail.com</p>

							<p>BY AIR:</p>
							
							<p> The nearest airport is Exeter, which is about 45 minutes by car, or 30 minutes by train to Totnes. Bristol Airport is also handy but a little further away, around 1.5 hours by car, or around 2 hours by train to Totnes. </p>

							<h3>Accomodation</h3>
							<p>There are plenty of B&amp;Bs, hotels, and holiday rentals in the area but if you want to camp we do have some space available.</p>
							<p>When looking for a B&amp;B the nearest towns are Buckfastleigh, Ashburton, Totnes, and Dartington. All are less than 15 minutes by car from the venue.</p>

							<p>We highly reccomend you take a look at <a href = 'airbnb.com' target= "_blank">AirBnB.com</a> where there are a lot of great private rentals in the area (we found Hockmoor House on there!)</p>

							<p>As this is peak holiday season we suggest you book your accomodation early. If you're having any trouble fnding somewhere, or want to buddy up look up our Facebook  <a href = 'https://www.facebook.com/events/1418579728416721/?ref=29&ref_notif_type=plan_user_joined&source=1' target= "_blank">Event Page</a> or give us a shout.</p>
