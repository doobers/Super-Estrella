							<h3>Devon - August 23rd</h3>
							<p>The wedding will be held in the grounds of Hockmoor House in the town of Buckfast (yep, <span class = "italic">that</span> <a href= 'https://www.google.com/search?q=Buckfast&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=bA2GU4DuBYbFOfTigdgK&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAg&biw=1056&bih=679' target= "_blank">Buckfast...</a>) on August 23rd. </p>

							<p>We have a beautiful marquee, with plenty of space for eating, drinking, and carousing, but please make sure you have suitable footwear and something warm for later on.</p>

							<p>Along with lots of delicious food we will be providing wine, fizz wine, and beer for you to enjoy with your meal. After that the party is BYOB, we will not have a cash bar so please do bring a bottle to share.</p>

							<p>Our field is a working pasture and we will be leaving it to the sheep and ponies once we go so please be extra careful with any rubbish, debris, or camping gear.</p>

							<p>A schedule for the day can be found, conveniently, in the schedule section.</p>

							<p>Scroll down or use the navigation menu to the left to explore more details.</p>

							<h3>Transport</h3>
							
							<p>BY CAR:</p> 
							
							<p>The venue is 5 minutes drive from the Bukfastleigh exit off the A38, we don't have a postcode but using google maps or sat nav the coordinates 50.493055, -3.791897, the entrance to the site is on Grange road (and we'll have a sign on the gate).

							<p>Below is a pin point map with directions from the main A38 turn off</p> 

							<p>When booking a cab you can ask the driver to pick up and collect at Hockmoor House, tell them it is the last driveway on the left before Hembury Woods, again, we'll have a sign!</p>

							<p>BY TRAIN:</p> 
							
							<p>Buckfast is also super easy to get to by train, with hourly trains running from London Paddington, via Exeter, to nearby Totnes. Once you get to Totnes, Buckfast is a short drive or cab journey away. </p>
							
							<p>OR (and here's where it gets exciting) there is a real life actual steam train from Totnes to Buckfastleigh! We will be organising a group rate ticket on the steam train and a shuttle from the steam train station to the venue so please let us know if you would like to take this option. you can let us know on the Facebok page or by emailing us at Shane.and.Layla.2014@gmail.com</p>

							<p>BY AIR:</p>
							
							<p> The nearest airport is Exeter, which is about 45 minutes by car, or 30 minutes by train to Totnes. Bristol Airport is also handy but a little further away, around 1.5 hours by car, or around 2 hours by train to Totnes. </p>

							<h3>Accomodation</h3>
							<p>There are plenty of B&amp;Bs, hotels, and holiday rentals in the area but if you want to camp we do have some space available.</p>
							<p>When looking for a B&amp;B the nearest towns are Buckfastleigh, Ashburton, Totnes, and Dartington. All are less than 15 minutes by car from the venue.</p>

							<p>We highly reccomend you take a look at <a href = 'airbnb.com' target= "_blank">AirBnB.com</a> where there are a lot of great private rentals in the area (we found Hockmoor House on there!)</p>

							<p>As this is peak holiday season we suggest you book your accomodation early. If you're having any trouble fnding somewhere, or want to buddy up look up our Facebook  <a href = 'https://www.facebook.com/events/1418579728416721/?ref=29&ref_notif_type=plan_user_joined&source=1' target= "_blank">Event Page</a> or give us a shout.</p>
